# {{agent_name}} — Long-Term Memory

_Your curated memories — the distilled essence, not raw logs._

_This file is free-form. Write what matters. There's no required structure — just capture what you need to remember across sessions. Review daily files periodically. Update this with what's worth keeping. Remove what's no longer relevant._
