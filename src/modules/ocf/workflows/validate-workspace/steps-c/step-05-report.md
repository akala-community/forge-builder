# Step 5: Validation Report

## STEP GOAL:

To compile the overall validation status from all check categories, generate a summary with actionable recommendations, present the report to the user, and offer next actions including auto-fix.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- If any instruction references a subprocess, subagent, or tool you do not have access to, you MUST still achieve the outcome in your main context
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- You are the **Quality Assurance** specialist -- reporting results
- Clear, actionable feedback
- Objective summary -- facts, not opinions

### Step-Specific Rules:

- Focus on compiling the report and presenting it clearly
- Provide actionable recommendations for any FAIL or WARN items
- FORBIDDEN to re-run checks -- just compile and summarize

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- Review all check sections and compile totals
- Append summary section to {validationReportOutput}
- HALT at menu and wait for user input (this is the final step -- user interaction returns)

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- All checks from steps 02-04 are complete and recorded in the report
- Focus on summarization and actionable guidance
- Dependencies: steps 02, 03, and 04 must be complete

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

### 1. Compile Overall Status

Review all check sections in {validationReportOutput} and count:
- Total [PASS] across all sections
- Total [FAIL] across all sections
- Total [WARN] across all sections
- Total [SKIP] across all sections

Determine overall status:
- **PASS:** Zero [FAIL] items and zero [WARN] items
- **WARNINGS:** Zero [FAIL] items but one or more [WARN] items
- **FAIL:** One or more [FAIL] items

### 2. Generate Recommendations

For each [FAIL] item, create a **Priority 1 (Critical)** recommendation:
- What failed
- What the fix is
- Why it matters

For each [WARN] item, create a **Priority 2 (Recommended)** recommendation:
- What triggered the warning
- What the fix is
- Why it is recommended

### 3. Append Summary to Report

Replace the "## Summary" section in {validationReportOutput} with:

```markdown
## Summary

**Overall Status:** {PASS/WARNINGS/FAIL}

### Totals

| Category | Pass | Fail | Warn | Skip |
|----------|------|------|------|------|
| Structural Checks | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n} |
| Coherence Checks | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n} |
| Hardening Checks | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n} |
| **Total** | **{n}** | **{n}** | **{n}** | **{n}** |

### Recommendations

#### Priority 1 -- Critical (must fix)

{List each FAIL item with fix guidance, or "None -- all critical checks passed."}

#### Priority 2 -- Recommended (should fix)

{List each WARN item with fix guidance, or "None -- no warnings."}

---

**Validation completed:** {current_date}
**Workspace:** {workspace_path}
```

Update the report frontmatter:
```yaml
validationStatus: {PASS/WARNINGS/FAIL}
```

### 4. Present Report to User

"**Validation complete!**

**Overall Status:** {PASS/WARNINGS/FAIL}

**Results:**
- {pass_count} checks passed
- {fail_count} checks failed
- {warn_count} warnings
- {skip_count} skipped

{If FAIL:}
**Critical issues found that must be fixed:**
{List each FAIL item briefly}

{If WARN:}
**Warnings to consider:**
{List top 3 WARN items briefly}

{If PASS and no warnings:}
**Workspace is fully consistent and hardened.**

**Report saved to:** `{validationReportOutput}`"

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**What would you like to do?**

- **[R]ead report** -- Show the full validation report
- **[F]ix issues** -- Auto-fix issues where possible (add missing sections, create missing files)
- **[D]one** -- Complete validation"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF R: Display the full content of {validationReportOutput}, then redisplay menu
- IF F: Attempt auto-fixes for issues that can be safely corrected:
  - Create missing optional files (TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md, BOOT.md) with starter templates
  - Add missing sections to SOUL.md (## Boundaries) or AGENTS.md (## Safety) with placeholder content
  - Create missing directories (memory/, skills/)
  - Delete BOOTSTRAP.md if it still exists
  - After fixes, re-summarize which issues were fixed and which require manual attention
  - Redisplay menu
- IF D: Complete the validation session
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond, then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions -- always respond and redisplay menu

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:

- Overall status correctly determined from all checks
- Pass/fail/warn totals accurate
- Actionable recommendations generated for every FAIL and WARN
- Summary appended to report
- Report presented clearly to user
- Menu presented with next actions including auto-fix

### SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Miscounting pass/fail/warn totals
- Not generating recommendations for failures
- Not saving summary to report
- Not presenting report to user
- Not offering auto-fix option

**Master Rule:** The report must be accurate, actionable, and clear. Compile everything from the previous steps into a useful summary.
