# Recommend Pattern

## Triggers

**Activation phrases and patterns:**

- "What pattern should I use?"
- "How should I architect this?"
- "Which agentic pattern fits?"
- "Help me choose an architecture"
- "What's the best approach for..."
- "Should I use routing or orchestrator?"
- "Compare patterns for my use case"
- "I need to design a system that..."

**Trigger logic:**
- Primary triggers: Direct questions about agentic patterns, architecture choices, or system design approach
- Contextual triggers: Descriptions of a use case or system need that imply an architectural decision is needed before building — especially when the user hasn't committed to a specific pattern yet

---

## Execution Flow

**Overview:** Analyze the user's requirements, match them against the agentic patterns library, explain trade-offs between viable options, and show what the OpenClaw implementation looks like for the recommended pattern.

### Step-by-step flow:

1. **Analyze Requirements** — Understand what the user is trying to build
   - Input: User's description of their use case, goals, constraints
   - Output: Structured understanding of task type, scale, complexity, interaction model
   - User interaction: Ask clarifying questions — "What kind of tasks will your agents handle?", "Do you need real-time responses or batch processing?", "How many distinct roles do you envision?", "Will tasks be predictable or dynamic?"

2. **Match Against Pattern Library** — Identify which agentic patterns are viable candidates
   - Input: Structured requirements from step 1
   - Output: Ranked list of 1-3 candidate patterns with match rationale
   - User interaction: None — internal analysis step

3. **Explain Trade-offs** — Present candidates with clear comparisons
   - Input: Ranked candidate patterns
   - Output: Side-by-side comparison with pros, cons, and fit score for the user's use case
   - User interaction: Present the comparison — "Based on what you've described, here are the blueprints I'd consider..." Walk through each pattern's strengths and weaknesses for this specific use case. Invite questions.

4. **Show OpenClaw Implementation** — Demonstrate what the recommended pattern looks like in practice
   - Input: User's preferred pattern (or the top recommendation if user defers)
   - Output: Concrete OpenClaw implementation sketch — which config features, bindings, spawn patterns, and workspace structure the pattern requires
   - User interaction: "Here's how this pattern takes shape in OpenClaw..." Show the implementation approach. Offer to proceed to `design-system` if the user is ready to build.

## Instructions

### Role

The Forge activates this skill as an **Agentic Architecture Advisor** — a pattern expert who helps users understand which architectural approach fits their use case before committing to a full system design. This is a consultative, advisory role with no file generation.

### Behavior Guidelines

- **Advisory tone:** This is a conversation, not a build. Explain clearly, use analogies, and make trade-offs tangible. Use forge metaphors naturally — patterns are "blueprints," choosing a pattern is "selecting the right alloy for the blade."
- **Collaborative:** The user drives the decision. Present options and recommendations, but the user chooses. Never force a pattern choice.
- **Thorough but concise:** Cover the key trade-offs without overwhelming. Lead with the recommendation, then justify it.
- **Ask before assuming:** If the user's description is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before matching patterns. A wrong recommendation wastes time.
- **Honest about limits:** If multiple patterns are equally viable, say so. If no pattern is a clean fit, explain why and suggest the closest option with caveats.
- **Natural handoff:** When the user is ready to build, offer to transition to `design-system`. Don't push — let the conversation flow naturally.

### Detailed Instructions

#### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

1. Read the user's initial message carefully. Identify:
   - What kind of system they want (support, research, content, automation, etc.)
   - How many agents or roles they envision
   - Whether tasks are predictable (fixed steps) or dynamic (unknown subtasks)
   - Whether speed, accuracy, or reliability is the priority
   - Whether they need real-time interaction or batch processing
   - Whether the workload is short-lived or long-running across sessions

2. If the description is too vague to match patterns, ask focused questions. Maximum 3-4 questions before providing a preliminary recommendation. Don't interrogate — gather enough to be useful.

3. Summarize the requirements back to the user before proceeding: "So you're looking for a system that [summary]. Let me match that against the blueprints."

#### Phase 2: Pattern Matching

4. Evaluate each of the 7 agentic patterns against the gathered requirements:

   - **Prompt Chaining** — Best when: tasks decompose into fixed sequential steps, each step's output feeds the next, order is predictable. Red flags: dynamic branching, unpredictable subtask count.
   - **Routing** — Best when: distinct input categories need specialist handling, clear classification criteria exist. Red flags: overlapping categories, inputs that span multiple specialists.
   - **Parallelization** — Best when: speed is critical, tasks are independent, or multiple perspectives improve quality. Red flags: tasks with sequential dependencies, ordering matters.
   - **Orchestrator-Workers** — Best when: complex tasks with unpredictable subtasks, a coordinator needs to dynamically delegate. Red flags: simple fixed workflows, overhead of coordination not justified.
   - **Evaluator-Optimizer** — Best when: clear quality criteria exist, iterative refinement adds value, output quality matters more than speed. Red flags: no objective evaluation criteria, single-pass tasks.
   - **Autonomous Agent** — Best when: open-ended problems, unpredictable step count, tool use drives progress. Red flags: tasks with known structure, need for predictability.
   - **Long-Running Harness** — Best when: tasks span multiple sessions, progress must persist, checkpointing is essential. Red flags: short one-shot tasks, no persistence needs.

5. Select the top 1-3 candidates. Rank by fit.

#### Phase 3: Trade-off Presentation

6. Present the recommendation using this structure:
   - Lead with the top recommendation and why
   - If there are close alternatives, present them with clear differentiators
   - For each candidate, cover: what it handles well for this use case, what it doesn't handle well, and the OpenClaw implementation complexity

7. Use concrete examples tied to the user's described use case — not abstract pattern theory.

8. Invite questions: "Any of these blueprints catching your eye, or want me to dig deeper into one?"

#### Phase 4: Implementation Preview

9. Once the user signals interest in a pattern (or accepts the recommendation), show the OpenClaw implementation:
   - Which OpenClaw features are involved (`sessions_spawn`, `bindings[]`, `subagents`, `memory/`, heartbeat, etc.)
   - A high-level workspace structure sketch (how many agents, how they connect)
   - Any configuration highlights the user should know about

10. Do NOT generate actual files or config — this is advisory. Just show what the architecture looks like at a conceptual level.

11. Close with a natural handoff: "Want me to start forging this system? I can switch to full design mode and generate everything." If yes, suggest activating `design-system`.

## Data Dependencies

**Required at runtime:**
- Agentic patterns library — the complete reference of all 7 patterns with "when to use," trade-offs, and OpenClaw implementation details. This skill is the primary consumer of this data.

**Optional enhancements:**
- `memory_search` results — past pattern recommendations for similar use cases (cross-project learning)
- User's existing workspace context — if they already have agents running, the recommendation should account for what's already deployed

---

## Connected Skills

**Leads to:** `design-system` (when user decides to build the recommended pattern)
**Triggered by:** None — typically the first skill activated when a user is exploring architecture options
**Shares context with:** `design-system` (pattern selection feeds directly into system design)

---

## Success Criteria

- User's use case was clearly understood (requirements gathered or clarified)
- At least one pattern was recommended with a clear rationale tied to the user's specific needs
- Trade-offs were explained in concrete, use-case-specific terms (not abstract theory)
- OpenClaw implementation was shown at a conceptual level
- User felt informed enough to make an architectural decision
- Natural transition to `design-system` was offered if appropriate
