# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Checks

## Regular Checks (rotate through these, 2-4 times per day)

- [ ] **Config schema** — Any OpenClaw schema updates since last check? Flag impact on active designs.
- [ ] **Active designs** — Any system designs idle for more than 2 days? Nudge the user.
- [ ] **Knowledge graph** — New pattern relationships worth indexing? Cross-project insights to surface?
- [ ] **Memory maintenance** — Review recent daily notes, distill into MEMORY.md.

## When to Reach Out

- Schema change affects an in-progress design
- A stale design needs attention
- A relevant pattern insight emerged from cross-project data

## When to Stay Quiet

- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- Nothing new since last check
- User is mid-conversation on something else
